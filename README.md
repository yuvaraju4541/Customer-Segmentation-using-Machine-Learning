### Customer segmentation using machine learning
### Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics such as demographics, behaviors, or purchasing habits. The goal of this project is to categorize customers into actionable segments, allowing for personalized marketing, sales, and service strategies. By leveraging data-driven techniques, the project will identify key segments, understand their behaviors and preferences, and tailor approaches to meet their unique needs.
The project will involve data collection, analysis, and segmentation using methods such as clustering, RFM analysis, and behavioral profiling. The insights gained will guide the development of targeted strategies that can boost customer engagement, improve retention, and drive overall business growth.
This will enable the company to improve marketing efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase revenue by focusing on high-value segments.
